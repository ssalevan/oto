Oto is a project which melds Selenium, dogtail, and python-nose together
to provide a Pythonic framework for establishing functional tests
suitable for testing large web and GTK client applications.

If you're interested in learning more, the base class (from which
all constituent test classes are defined) can be found within
oto/base.py.

All bugs, comments, concerns, rants, raves, expressions of love,
expressions of hate, and James Joyce-ian freeform expressions
should be directed towards me, the author of this package:

Steve Salevan <steve.salevan@gmail.com>

I hope that these tools spirit you swiftly towards a happier place
in your testing trevails, and if I can be of any assistance, feel
free to drop me an e-mail.  :}
